## SF Crime Classification (Kaggle)
This is my attempt at the SF Crime Classification competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime). The competition uses data from the 12 years of crime in SF. I used this as a practice in data visualization using R. 

### Dataset Description

Category - category of the crime incident (only in train.csv). This is the target variable you are going to predict.
Descript - detailed description of the crime incident (only in train.csv)
DayOfWeek - the day of the week
PdDistrict - name of the Police Department District
Resolution - how the crime incident was resolved (only in train.csv)
Address - the approximate street address of the crime incident
